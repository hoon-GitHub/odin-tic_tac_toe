### Takeaway
- Learned and used factory functions and closures, for variable privacy and overall security.
  - Understood **why** and **how** to use factory functions, IIFE, closures, and etc.
- Learned how to build from the inside out:
  - As instructed, worked on the **console version** of the game first, before even starting on the UI.
  - Game was fully functioning in the console - html and css was pretty empty at this point.
  - Then built the UI, and converting/connecting the JS with the DOM was much easier.

### Thoughts
- Would it be better to use one-dimension array? It could have been easier (and less code), especially for associating the array with the DOM elements, and probably for checking against the winning conditions.
- Maybe I should try to use CSS variables for colors in the future.
- I think I am learning how and when to use grid and/or flexbox: currently trying to use both, so I can learn..
- I am also learning the basics of markdown, by writing this README file. This is great!
